# pokmcode

Code brainstorming for a non-profit indie Pokemon game
by two contributors; dankmonk and mukavastinumb.


PURPOSE OF main.py
------------------------

Currently main.py functions as a grid layout generator for any maps that
it loads from the respective list that now only consists of a single level.


KEYBINDS AND GOALS OF main.py
-----------------------------

The goal for now is to collide with the yellow circles that represent events or "goals"
in this particular instance. The program will keep score of the objects. The purpose of this
is to make sure that during actual gameplay the program has the ability to distinguish
multiple and separate events on a grid that all serve a predefined in-game purpose.

KEYBINDS (KEYPAD):
Up: KEY_UP
Down: KEY_DOWN
Left: KEY_LEFT
Right: KEY_RIGHT
